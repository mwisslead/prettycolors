# Pretty Colors
Generate some decent looking colors without repeating similar colors.

# Concept
  The idea for this code is based on something I saw in this [VI Hart video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIP_Z_-0Hs).
Basically generate the next color by adding the golden angle to the HSV value of the previous color
which creates colors with minimal overlap of the hue.

# Output
Colors generated by `generate_color(i)` from 0 to 23

Colors returned by `generate_colors(24)`
